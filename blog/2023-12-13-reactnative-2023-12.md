#### Q: What is React Native? 

A: React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It's used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and Universal Windows Platform by allowing developers to use React along with native platform capabilities.

#### Q: How is React Native different from React? 

A: While React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for web applications, React Native is a framework for building mobile applications using React and JavaScript. It allows one to build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React.

#### Q: What is JSX in React Native? 

A: JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It's a syntax extension for JavaScript, used for defining what the UI should look like. React components are written using JSX, though it’s not a requirement, it makes code easier to write and understand.

#### Q: What is a component in React Native? 

A: Components are the building blocks of any React Native application and a typical React Native app will have many of these. Simply put, a component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs, i.e., properties(props), and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI should appear.

#### Q: How do you handle state in React Native applications? 

A: State is handled in React Native applications using a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belong to a specific component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

#### Q: What is the difference between state and props? 

A: Both props and state are plain JavaScript objects. While props allow you to pass data down from a parent component to child components, the state is managed within the component (stateful components).

#### Q: What is Redux in React Native? 

A: Redux is a standalone state management library, which can be used with any library or framework. It's most commonly used with React or React Native for building user interfaces. Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments and are easy to test.

#### Q: What are some advantages of using React Native? 

A: Some of the advantages of using React Native include efficient code sharing across iOS, Android, and the web, without sacrificing the end user's experience or application quality. The framework also provides a rich ecosystem of pre-built components that can accelerate the development process. Furthermore, since it's built on top of React, it provides a better performance than other similar solutions like Cordova or Ionic.

#### Q: What is a Virtual DOM? 

A: Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal or virtual representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the real DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. When state changes in a component it firstly runs the diffing algorithm, which identifies what has changed and then updates the components based only on these changes. This is why React is so fast.

#### Q: How does 'Hot Reloading' work in React Native? 

A: Hot Reloading is a mechanism that allows developers to save changes to files during runtime, and have the output updated directly without requiring a full reload. It uses HMR (Hot Module Replacement) API implemented in bundlers like Webpack to apply changes without reloading the app.

#### Q: What is Flexbox? 

A: Flexbox is a layout module introduced into the CSS standard as a means for creating complex UI layouts in the browser more easily. React Native applies this same layout model to mobile apps for a more intuitive and adaptable way of structuring layouts.

#### Q: How can you handle user input in React Native? 

A: React Native provides a TextInput component to handle user input. This component includes properties such as onChangeText and onSubmitEditing that one can use to capture changes in input.

#### Q: What is NPM and Yarn? 

A: NPM and Yarn are package managers for Node.js that enables developers to share and reuse JavaScript modules. They help you manage and track dependencies for your project.

#### Q: How can you style your components in React Native? 

A: In React Native, you can use JavaScript to style your components. It has a concept called "Stylesheet" that is similar to CSS stylesheets, with a few restrictions: you can't use all the CSS3 functionalities and there are several properties that only pertain to certain components.

#### Q: How do you install plugins or libraries in your React Native project? 

A: You can install plugins or libraries in your React Native project using npm or yarn. For example, if you are using npm, you can issue a command like 'npm install --save `<library-name>`' in the terminal. After installation, you may need to link the library to your project using the 'react-native link' command (though this is automatic with React Native v0.60 and above, thanks to auto-linking).

#### Q: Can React Native apps be distributed in the same way as traditional native apps? 

A: Yes, React Native apps can be distributed in the same way as traditional native apps. They can be uploaded to the different app stores - Google Play Store for Android, and App Store for iOS, following the usual submission process.

#### Q: What is a Pure Component in React? 

A: A Pure Component in React is a performance optimization over regular React components that prevent re-renders if the props remain shallowly equal to the previous version.

#### Q: What is the purpose of 'reducers' in Redux? 

A: Reducers are used to maintain and manipulate the state in Redux. They are pure functions that take the current state and action as arguments and return the next state of the application without modifying the input.

#### Q: What are 'props' in React Native? 

A: 'props' is short for 'properties'. They are how components talk to each other. If you think of components as function calls, props are the function arguments.

#### Q: What is 'state' in React Native? 

A: 'state' is a built-in React object that stores property values that belong to a component. Any time the state changes, the component re-renders.

#### Q: What are 'hooks' in React Native? 

A: 'hooks' are a new addition to React that lets you use state and other React features without writing a class. Some examples include useState, useEffect, and useContext.

#### Q: How do you navigate between screens in React Native? 

A: React Navigation is a popular library to manage transitions and interactions between screens in your app. With it, you can set up a 'stack navigator' for pages that are linked linearly, a 'tab navigator' for switching between functions of your app, or a 'drawer navigator' for navigating a list of options in a sidebar.

#### Q: How do you persist state in React Native? 

A: Redux Persist is a handy library for persisting and rehydrating a Redux store. On the other hand, for simpler use cases, you might consider using React's built-in AsyncStorage API.

#### Q: How do you handle forms in React Native? 

A: React Native handles forms along with form validation in a similar manner as regular React. It offers controlled components where you can set and read form data via state and naturally integrates along with other libraries like formik or redux-form.

#### Q: How do you manage environment variables in React Native? 

A: For managing environment variables, libraries like 'react-native-dotenv' can be utilized. This allows you to import environment variables in your JS and automatically chooses the correct file (.env.development, .env.production) based on command (npm start, npm run build).

#### Q: What is a Higher Order Component (HOC) in React? 

A: A Higher-Order Component (HOC) in React is a pattern derived from React’s compositional nature. HOCs are a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or features.

#### Q: Can you explain the 'useState' hook in React Native? 

A: 'useState' is a built-in hook you can use to handle state in a functional component. It accepts the initial state as its argument and returns an array containing the current state value and a function you can use to update it.

#### Q: What's the role of a 'key' prop in a list of elements in React Native? 

A: Keys are used by React to identify which items in the list have changed, been updated, or deleted. Each key should be distinct and stable across renders for performance optimization.

#### Q: Can you explain the 'useEffect' hook in React Native? 

A: 'useEffect' is a built-in hook that accepts a callback that will be executed after the component has been rendered to the screen. It's typically used for making network requests, setting up subscriptions, and manually changing the DOM in React components, among other side effects.

#### Q: What are context and providers in React Native? 

A: Context provides a method of passing data through the component tree without needing to pass props down manually at every level. A Provider is a type of component that accepts a value prop to be passed to consuming components down the tree.

#### Q: What is the 'useContext' hook in React Native? 

A: 'useContext' is a built-in hook that accepts a context object and gives you back the current context value for that context. It enables you to subscribe to React context updates.

#### Q: How does error handling work in React Native? 

A: You can use componentDidCatch method or ErrorBoundary class component to catch errors in components. On the other hand, async/await makes it easier to handle promises where try/catch can be used to handle errors.

#### Q: What are refs in React Native? 

A: Refs are a function provided by React that allow us to store a reference to a particular element or component in the component's instance property. This can be useful when you need to change the value of a child component without making use of props and also to trigger focus or text selection in user input.

#### Q: How do you handle animations in React Native? 

A: React Native provides built-in Animated API for animations. It provides a way to declaratively control different native properties and animate them over time.

#### Q: What is 'Expo' in React Native? 

A: Expo is a toolchain built around React Native that provides a layer of simplicity when building and deploying React Native apps. With Expo you gain access to built-in plugins, easy builds and deployments, and a web-based IDE.

#### Q: What’s the significance of Expo in React Native? 

A: Expo is a framework for React Native that provides a set of tools and services built around React Native, allowing you to build and start projects with ease. It simplifies the process of deploying and publishing the app. With Expo, you can build an app without needing xCode or Android Studio.

#### Q: Could you explain the class lifecycle in React Native? 

A: Every component in React Native goes through a lifecycle of events. You can think it as the birth, growth, and death of your component. The main lifecycle events are constructor, render, componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

#### Q: What is a FlatList in React Native? 

A: FlatList is a core component provided by React Native, used to render basic, flat list, scrollable list of items, and it also has several handy features, like pull-to-refresh, header and footer support, column view, infinite scroll loading, etc.

#### Q: What is the role of React.Children? 

A: React.Children provides utilities for dealing with this.props.children (a component's child elements) in a more convenient fashion. It has several methods including map, forEach, toArray and so on.

#### Q: Can you talk about how navigation works in React Native? 

A: Navigation between screens is an important part of any application. In React Native, this is done using a Navigator component. There are several navigation libraries in the ecosystem, like React Navigation, React Native Navigation, etc.

#### Q: How do you handle local data storage in React Native? 

A: React Native provides built-in support for local data storage using AsyncStorage. There are also other libraries like realm, redux-persist and sqlite that can handle much larger datasets and complex data objects.

#### Q: What is Redux Thunk used for in a React Native application? 

A: Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you invoke action creators that return a function instead of an action object. That function receives the store's dispatch method, which is then used to dispatch regular synchronous actions inside the body of the function once the asynchronous operations have completed.

#### Q: What is the role of 'Linking' in React Native? 

A: The ‘Linking’ library is used in React Native to open or access the URL’s. Either we can open the URL in Web Browser, or we can use it to communicate between apps in the mobile device.

#### Q: What are some common performance issues in React Native applications and how can they be mitigated? 

A: A common issue is rendering too many components at once, which can slow down an app. This can be mitigated by the use of FlatList and SectionList, which render only what’s visible on the screen. Another common issue is inefficient Redux setup. Ensuring that components are re-rendered only when necessary (by fine-tuning the mapStateToProps function) can help with this.

#### Q: How can you create responsive designs in React Native? 

A: React Native's flexbox layout system allows your components to automatically adapt to the screen size. You can also use the Dimensions API or third-party libraries, as well as using the platform-specific design pattern of either material design or human interface.

#### Q: What is a TouchableHighlight in React Native? 

A: TouchableHighlight is a component used to wrap view elements that need to be interactive such as touch or press events. It is used to provide feedback on user interaction by darkening the color or reducing the opacity of the button.

#### Q: What is the importance of keys in a FlatList? 

A: Keys are used to identify specific items in the array. They help React to re-render only those items that have changed instead of re-rendering all the items in the list.

#### Q: What are the limitations of React Native? 

A: While React Native is a powerful tool for building mobile apps using JavaScript, it has several limitations:

- It is slower than native app development languages.
The navigation can feel less smooth than it does in native applications.
- Not all functionalities of native SDKs are available, and for some complex interactions, developers might have to write native code.
- Depending on React Native means depending on the community for additional libraries, plugins, and modules.

#### Q: What is a functional component in React Native? 

A: In React and React Native, a functional component is a component defined as a function in JavaScript. These components don't maintain their own state or have access to the lifecycle methods provided by React Native unless they use Hooks.

#### Q: How can we use vector icons in React Native? 

A: There are packages such as react-native-vector-icons that provide a wide variety of icons to use in React Native projects. After installing the package, it's as easy as importing the icon (from the specific set the icon belongs to) and then using it as a component in your project.

#### Q: Can you use TypeScript with React Native? 

A: Yes, TypeScript can be used with React Native, and it brings static type-checking along with the latest ECMAScript features. It enhances the developer's experience by providing autocompletion, type inference, and type checking.

#### Q: What is Snap Carousel in React Native?

#### Q: How do you test React Native Components? 

A: Jest is the recommended testing framework for React Native. Enzyme, a testing framework developed by Airbnb, is often used in combination with Jest. It provides additional functionality for testing components.

#### Q: What is memoization in React? 

A: Memoization is a technique in React that optimizes your components to avoid complex re-rendering. If your component renders the same result given the same props, you can wrap it in a call to React.memo for a performance boost in some cases by memoizing the result.

#### Q: What is Fast Refresh in React Native? 

A: Fast Refresh is a React Native feature that allows you to get near-instant feedback for changes in your React components, without losing their state.

#### Q: What are some popular packages used with React Native? 

A: Some popular React Native packages include react-navigation for routing and navigation, axios or fetch for HTTP requests, redux for state management, react-native-vector-icons for icons, and react-native-elements to provide a useful set of pre-built components.

#### Q: How can you use custom fonts in React Native? 

A: To use custom fonts in React Native, you have to first import the font files into your project and configure them in your react-native.config.js file. After that, you can use them like you would use any standard font in your styles.

#### Q: How do you manage configurations for different environments in React Native? 

A: You can manage different environments in React Native using environment variables. react-native-config is a popular package that lets you set up different variables for different environments.

#### Q: How can you improve performance in a React Native application? 

A: Some ways to improve performance in React Native include using PureComponent when possible to prevent unnecessary re-renders, optimizing state management, being cautious with console log statements in the production app, properly managing memory and efficiently loading and displaying images.

#### Q: How can you debug a React Native application? 

A: You can debug a React Native application using the built-in React Native Debugger, which is available while the application is running in development mode. You can also use other tools like Reactotron, Flipper or the browser's console along with the console.log function.

#### Q: What is the difference between React.PureComponent and React.Component? 

A: The difference lies in the shouldComponentUpdate() lifecycle method. React.Component doesn’t implement this method, and as a result, always re-renders when state or props change. On the other hand, React.PureComponent implements this method with a shallow comparison for props and state, allowing you to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the state or props haven't actually changed.

#### Q: What are synthetic events in React Native? 

A: Synthetic events in React Native are akin to cross-browser wrappers around the browser’s native events, implemented to ensure that the events have consistent properties across different browsers.

#### Q: What is the typical flow data in Redux? 

A: The flow of data in Redux is unidirectional. Actions are dispatched to inform the store that certain events have occurred. Reducers handle these actions and return a new state. The store updates based on the returned state, and the UI re-renders based on the new state.

#### Q: How do you manage app state in React Native? 

A: There are several ways to manage app state in React Native. For small apps, setState and Context API might be sufficient. Larger applications typically require a more robust solution like Redux, MobX or Apollo Client.

#### Q: How would you handle image caching in React Native? 

A: React Native doesn't support image caching out of the box. You have to use third-party libraries like react-native-fast-image which support caching.

#### Q: What is shouldComponentUpdate method in React Native? 

A: The shouldComponentUpdate method is a lifecycle method that determines whether a component should be re-rendered or not based on changes in state or props. By default, it returns true.

#### Q: What is a way to persist app state in React Native? 

A: A simple way to persist app state in React Native is to use AsyncStorage. However, other libraries like redux-persist, react-native-sqlite-storage, or realm, can handle larger amounts of data and complex objects for larger applications.

#### Q: What is the purpose of SafeAreaView in React Native? 

A: SafeAreaView is a component which automatically adjusts its children components to accommodate the notches, home indicators, and other design features of different devices, particularly newer iPhones.

#### Q: How can you handle deep linking in React Native? 

A: Deep linking can be handled in React Native with theLinking API, which allows the app to interact with both incoming and outgoing app links.

#### Q: What are the advantages of using hooks in React components? 

A: Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. It also helps in reducing the lines of code and makes the logic easier to follow in comparison to lifecycle methods.

#### Q: What is a Reducer in Redux? 

A: A reducer is a pure function in Redux that takes the current state and an action as an argument and returns a new state without mutating the input state.

#### Q: What are Props in React Native? 

A: Props are shorthand for properties in React native. They are used to pass data from parent components to child components and are immutable.

#### Q: How can we implement a pull-to-refresh functionality in React Native? 

A: React Native's ScrollView, FlatList and SectionList components have a special prop called refreshControl which can be set to a RefreshControl component. The RefreshControl has a refreshing prop indicating whether the refresh operation is active.

#### Q: How does error handling work in React Native? 

A: Error boundaries in React allow you to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. This is done by defining a new lifecycle method called componentDidCatch in your component.

#### Q: How do you manage user sessions in React Native? 

A: Managing user sessions in React Native typically involves leveraging a backend API to create and manage sessions and using AsyncStorage or other methods to persist session information within the app.

#### Q: How do you use geolocation in React Native? 

A: React Native has a built-in API called Geolocation, which allows accessing the geographic location of a device. By using navigator.geolocation object available in React Native, you can get the user's current location coordinates.

#### Q: How do you handle permissions in React Native? 

A: You can use libraries like 'react-native-permissions' for managing permissions. For example, if your application needs access to the device's camera or location, you can use these libraries to ask the user for permission.

#### Q: How does data flow in Redux? 

A: In Redux, data flows in a unidirectional loop. Actions are dispatched to the store, the store calls reducers with the current state and the dispatched action, reducers compute and return the new state to the store, and lastly, the store triggers an UI update to reflect the new state.

#### Q: How can you handle screen orientation changes in React Native? 

A: The Dimensions API in React Native can detect changes in screen dimensions, i.e., whenever a device is rotated. You can then create dynamic styles that will adapt to changes in screen orientation.

#### Q: What is realm in React Native? 

A: Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets, or wearables. It provides an alternative to SQLite and Core Data. You can freely map JavaScript objects to the database, and it's much faster than existing databases.

#### Q: What is a ScrollView in React Native? 

A: A ScrollView is a generic scrolling container that offers a convenient way to display content that is larger than the screen. It enables users to scroll within that content. However, for a large amount of data, ListView or FlatList is preferred as they have better performance characteristics.

#### Q: How can you play sounds in React Native? 

A: React Native doesn't support playing sounds out of the box. You'll need to use a third-party library like react-native-sound, which provides audio playback functionality for both Android and iOS.

#### Q: What is react-navigation in React Native? 

A: React Navigation is a popular library to manage transitions and interactions between screens in your React Native app. It handles the navigation header, tab bars, stack navs, etc., and can be used for both iOS and Android.

#### Q: What are some ways to handle async operations in Redux? 

A: There are multiple ways to handle async operations in Redux like Redux Thunk, Redux Saga, Redux Observable, etc. They each have unique features so you can pick the one that best suits your project's needs.

#### Q: Can you describe styled-components in React Native? 

A: Styled-components is a CSS-in-JS styling framework that uses tagged template literals in JavaScript and the awesome power of CSS to provide a platform that allows you to write actual CSS to style your components. It keeps track of which components are rendered on a page and injects their styles fully automatically, which means you have automatic critical CSS.

#### Q: How to use SVG in React Native? 

A: SVGs can be used in React Native using react-native-svg library, which provides SVG support to React Native on iOS and Android, and a collection of SVG element components.

#### Q: What are higher-order components (HOCs) in React Native? 

A: In React, higher-order components (or HOCs) are a type of reusable component logic. They are not part of the rendering UI and are a way of reusing component logic. HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with added functionality.

#### Q: How can you run a background task in React Native? 

A: Running background tasks in React Native can be accomplished using libraries like react-native-background-job or react-native-background-fetch. However, the functionality of these tasks are often limited by the operating system, particularly on iOS.

#### Q: What is a headless JS task in React Native? 

A: A headless task is a JavaScript task that runs without a user interface or an app being in the foreground. For example, this can be useful to run tasks that sync data in the background or process heavy data.

#### Q: Can WebView be used inside a React Native application? 

A: Yes, WebView can be used for displaying web pages inside your React Native application. It renders web content in a native view and can also load static HTML.

#### Q: How do you handle form input validations in a React Native form? 

A: There are libraries like Formik and react-hook-form that provide form state management including validation. Custom validation can also be performed by managing form state manually, using React Native's state and prop mechanisms.

#### Q: What is GraphQL and can it be used with React Native? 

A: GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime to fulfill those queries with existing data. It's an alternative to REST for developing APIs, not a database technology. Yes, GraphQL can be used with React Native through libraries like Apollo Client.

#### Q: How do you test React Native apps? 

A: React Native can be unit tested with Jest and render tested with either React Test Renderer or Enzyme. For integration testing, Detox or Appium is often used.

#### Q: How can you handle push notifications in a React Native app? 

A: Push notifications can be set up in React Native using services like Firebase Cloud Messaging along with libraries like react-native-push-notification or Expo's push notification service in case of using Expo.

#### Q: How can you localize a React Native app? 

A: To localize a React Native app, you can use platform APIs (like for date, time, numbers) and libraries like i18n-js or react-native-localization.

#### Q: How do you handle user authentication in React Native? 

A: User authentication in React Native can be managed using tools like Firebase, Auth0, or any other backend service. You can also manage it manually with your own backend.

#### Q: What is the importance of index.js in a React Native application? 

A: The index.js file in a React Native application serves as the entry point for the application. It imports and utilizes the AppRegistry module to register your application with React Native.

#### Q: How do you update state in React Native? 

A: State in React Native or React can be updated using the setState function. This API updates the state object and tells React that the component and its children need to be re-rendered with the updated state.

#### Q: What is a component in React Native? 

A: In React Native, a component is an independent reusable piece that describes a part of your application UI. Components can either be stateful (class components) or stateless (functional components).

#### Q: How do you send a network request in React Native? 

A: React Native supports the Fetch API for networking needs, including sending requests, receiving responses, or handling errors. It also supports other APIs like XmlHttpRequest.

#### Q: How can you use Firebase with React Native? 

A: React Native Firebase is a light-weight layer on top of the native Firebase SDKs providing smooth native integration with 20+ Firebase services. It is used not only to connect but also to perform the various functionalities of Firebase like Authentication, Realtime Database, Firestore, Storage, etc. that help to develop high-quality applications.

#### Q: How can you style components in React Native? 

A: Styling components in React Native is done via the style prop. Styles are defined in a JavaScript object, which contains key-value pairs wherein the keys are in camelCase. Inline styles are also used, however, they are often impractical for larger applications.

#### Q: What are controlled components in React Native? 

A: In HTML, a form element such as input, textarea, or select could maintain their own state, which is updated based on user input. In React Native, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components and is updated using setState() method. A controlled component takes its current value through props and notifies changes through callbacks like onChange.

#### Q: What are some challenges in React Native app development? 

A: Some challenges in React Native app development include navigation implementation, memory management, native code requirements for certain functionalities, more complex debugging, difficulty in customizing UI based on platform, bridge performance, and built-in support for gestures and animations.
